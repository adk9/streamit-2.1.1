runtime system, version 2.1.1.<BR>

StreamIt is a programming language designed for efficient
implementation of streaming systems, particularly digital signal
processing applications. This is a public release of the StreamIt
compiler. While the compiler is still under active development, we
believe this release should be useful for developing StreamIt
applications. See "caveats", below, and report bugs and feature
requests to <TT>streamit@cag.csail.mit.edu</TT>. This compiler should
produce functional code for uniprocessor targets, multicore
architectures, clusters of workstations, and the MIT Raw processor.
There is also a runtime library for testing programs through a Java
compiler.<BR>
<BR>
There are two versions of this release. These are:
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT>
<B>streamit-src-2.1.1.tar.gz</B><DD> "Source release." This contains the
 full sources of the StreamIt compiler and runtime libraries, but no
 binaries. Build instructions are included in the INSTALL file.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>streamit-2.1.1.tar.gz</B><DD> "Binary release." This contains no
 sources, but does contain a Java jar file with the full compiler.
</DL>
The StreamIt compiler is built on top of version 1.5B of the Kopi Java
compiler from DMS Decision Management Systems GmbH. The independent
components of the system, including the scheduler, Java runtime
library, C/C++ libraries, the front end, and the StreamIt .str files,
are released subject to the terms of the MIT license agreement. Other
components of the system are released under the terms of the GNU
General Public License; see the <FONT COLOR=purple>COPYING</FONT> file for details.
The binary release also include class files from the ANTLR LL(k)
parser generator.<BR>
<BR>
Several documents on StreamIt are in the <FONT COLOR=purple>docs</FONT> directory.
You can find more information on our Web page, at
<A HREF="http://cag.csail.mit.edu/streamit/"><TT>http://cag.csail.mit.edu/streamit/</TT></A>.<BR>

<!--TOC section Dependencies-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc2">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dependencies</H2><!--SEC END -->

The StreamIt makefile infrastructure uses the GNU tools, which are
available from <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org"><TT>http://www.gnu.org</TT></A>. In particular, GNU Make is
required to build; this is the default &lt;tt&gt;make&lt;/tt&gt; on Linux
machines, and may be available as &lt;tt&gt;gmake&lt;/tt&gt; on other Unix-like
machines. The source release depends on Sun's Java compiler (javac).
Both the source and binary releases require a Java virtual machine for
Java version 1.5 or later; see <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/"><TT>http://java.sun.com/</TT></A> for
possibilities.<BR>
<BR>
The front end depends on the ANTLR LL(<I>k</I>) parser generator; see
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/"><TT>http://www.antlr.org/</TT></A>. If you are using the source release, the
ANTLR classes must be in your Java <FONT COLOR=purple>CLASSPATH</FONT> when compiling
and running the StreamIt compiler. If you are using the binary
release, the required ANTLR classes are already included in the
StreamIt jar file.<BR>
<BR>
The linear optimizations (not turned on by default) depend on the FFTW
library; see <A HREF="http://www.fftw.org/"><TT>http://www.fftw.org/</TT></A>. The StreamIt runtime system
currently only supports fftw-2.1.x, not the newer fftw-3.0 branch.
FFTW should be installed somewhere in your default compiler search
path. You need to build single-precision versions of the library,
such that you have include files <FONT COLOR=purple>sfftw.h</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR=purple>srfftw.h</FONT> and library files <FONT COLOR=purple>libsfftw.a</FONT> and
<FONT COLOR=purple>libsrfftw.a</FONT>. 
The linear optimizations are turned on only if <TT>configure</TT>
can find all four files. 
 If you are building FFTW from source, pass 
the following options to configure: <TT>--enable-shared --enable-type-prefix --enable-threads</TT> <BR>
<TT>--enable-float</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
While this is not a a dependency, the <TT>graphviz</TT> package from
<A HREF="http://www.graphviz.org"><TT>http://www.graphviz.org</TT></A> contains a viewer, <TT>dotty</TT>, that
will display the dot files created by the StreamIt compiler.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Caveats-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc3">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Caveats</H2><!--SEC END -->

This is a <EM>snapshot</EM> release of the StreamIt compiler. This is a
research compiler; as such, it has several known shortcomings:
<UL><LI>The compiler works by converting StreamIt syntax to a Java
 intermediate form, and then using a Java compiler. Of note,
 compiling 'foo.str' will clobber a file named 'foo.java' in the
 same directory.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The dimensions of a filter field cannot be declared in terms of
another filter field. That is, code of the following form will fail:
<PRE>
float-&gt;float filter Foo {
  int N = 10;
  float[N] coeff;
  ...
}
</PRE>In such cases, just declare the array to be <CODE>float[10]</CODE>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In splitjoins and feedbackloops, splitters and joiners cannot be
specified from within conditional code. For example, the following
code causes problems:
<PRE>
float-&gt;float splitjoin Bar {
  if (...) {
    split duplicate;
  } else {
    split roundrobin;
  }
}
</PRE>If you really need such a conditional, then define two separate
splitjoins (Bar1 and Bar2) and do the test when adding them to a
parent stream:
<PRE>
float-&gt;float pipeline Parent {
  if (...) {
    add Bar1(); // uses duplicate splitter
  } else {
    add Bar2(); // uses roundrobin splitter
  }
}
</PRE><LI>The compiler does not support passing structures or complex
 numbers as stream parameters. This will result in an error such as
<PRE>
at.dms.util.InconsistencyException: Expected constant arguments to
init, but found non-constant VarExp:p in parent SIRPipeline
name=pipe_3
</PRE>
 Structures and complex should work as local variables and as the
 input or output types of filters.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Arrays cannot be returned from helper functions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In most back ends, arrays cannot be used as the input or output
types of streams. This is largely a limitation in the uniprocessor
back end; you can get equivalent code by using streams of the base type
of the array, and constructing the array inside the work function if
necessary.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The <TT>static block</TT>s are limited (except in the Java
library back end) in that they act as specified only if every declared
variable in the static block is assigned to exactly
once. Furthermore, there can currently be at most one static block in
a program.</UL>
