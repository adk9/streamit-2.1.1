<H1 ALIGN=center>StreamIt Semantic Checks</H1>


This document contains a list of semantic checks that should be
performed on StreamIt programs after they have been parsed. These
assume the program is syntactically correct; it must pass through the
parser correctly.<BR>

<!--TOC subsection Init, Work, and Helper Functions-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc2">1.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Init, Work, and Helper Functions</H3><!--SEC END -->

<OL type=1><LI>
<CODE>add</CODE> statements can only appear in init functions in
 split-joins and pipelines;

 declares a push rate, though, it must call
 <CODE>push</CODE>.<SUP><A NAME="text1" HREF="#note1"><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></A></SUP>
<LI>Every filter must have a work function.

<!--TOC subsection Control Flow and Initialization Code-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc3">1.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Control Flow and Initialization Code</H3><!--SEC END -->

Several statements may only be executed once per function; other
statements are sensitive to the order in which they are executed.
<OL type=1><LI>
<CODE>split</CODE>, <CODE>join</CODE>, <CODE>body</CODE>, and
 <CODE>loop</CODE> statements must be executed exactly once if they
 are allowed at all. Every path of control through the
 initialization code must result in exactly one execution.
</OL>

<!--TOC subsection Stream Connections-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc5">2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stream Connections</H3><!--SEC END -->

``Match'' within this section means an <EM>exact</EM> match in type;
there is no implicit type promotion across tapes.
<OL type=1><LI>
For a pipeline, the input type must match the input type of the
 first child and the output type of the last child must match the
 output type of the pipeline.
<LI>Within a pipeline, the output type of one child must match the
 input type of the next child.
<LI>The input type of each of a split-join's children must be either
 the input type of the split-join or <CODE>void</CODE>. Identical
 constraints hold for the output.
<LI>The output type of a feedback loop's loop stream must match the
 input type of its body stream. The input type of the feedback loop
 must be either the same type as the body input or <CODE>void</CODE>.
 Identical constraints hold for the output side of the feedback loop.
<LI>Exactly one stream in the program has the stream type
 <CODE>void-&gt;void</CODE>. This stream must be named.
</OL>
<!--TOC subsection Implications of Stream Types-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc6">2.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implications of Stream Types</H3><!--SEC END -->

<OL type=1><LI>
The splitter of a split-join must be
 <CODE>roundrobin(0)</CODE> if the input type of the stream is
 <CODE>void</CODE>; it may not be <CODE>roundrobin(0)</CODE> otherwise.
 Identical constraints hold for the output.
<LI>If a split-join has some children with <CODE>void</CODE> inputs and
 some children with non-<CODE>void</CODE> inputs, the splitter must be
 a round-robin splitter with a declared weight of 0 for each of the
 <CODE>void</CODE> children. Identical constraints hold for the
 output and the joiner.
<LI>The splitter and joiner of a feedback loop must accomodate
 exactly two children. If the body and loop children have
 non-<CODE>void</CODE> input and output types, then the joiner must be
 equivalent to <CODE>roundrobin(0,1)</CODE> if the input of the loop
 is <CODE>void</CODE>, and similarly for the splitter and the output.
<LI>If the input type of a feedback loop's body child is
 <CODE>void</CODE>, then the loop input type and loop child output
 type must also be <CODE>void</CODE>, and the joiner must be
 <CODE>roundrobin(0)</CODE>. Identical constraints hold for the loop
 output and splitter.
<LI>If the input type of a filter is <CODE>void</CODE>, all of its
 work functions must declare peek and pop rates of 0; if its output
 type is <CODE>void</CODE>, all of its work functions must have a push
 rate of 0.

<!--TOC subsection Statements and Expressions-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc7">2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Statements and Expressions</H3><!--SEC END -->

<OL type=1><LI>
Types can be promoted: a <CODE>bit</CODE> can be implicitly
 converted to an <CODE>int</CODE>, an <CODE>int</CODE> can be promoted
 to a <CODE>float</CODE>, and a <CODE>float</CODE> can be promoted to
 <CODE>complex</CODE>.
<LI>Every referenced variable must have a declared type.
<LI>Every expression has a type:
<OL type=a><LI>
The type of a variable reference is the type of the variable;
<LI>The type of a literal is the lowest type that can contain the
 literal (the type of <CODE>1</CODE> is <CODE>bit</CODE>, the type of
 <CODE>2</CODE> is <CODE>int</CODE>, the type of <CODE>2.0</CODE> is
 <CODE>float</CODE>, and the type of <CODE>2i</CODE> is
 <CODE>complex</CODE>);
<LI>The type of a unary expression is the type of the child
 expression. The type of a binary expression is the join of the
 types of the child expression, possibly promoted to a type the
 operator can accept. The type of the first part of the ternary
 expression must be promotable to <CODE>int</CODE>, and the second and
 third parts must be promotable to a common type; the resulting type
 is the common type. In all cases, the types of child expressions
 must conform to the acceptable types for the operator listed in the
 language specification.
<LI>For a field reference <CODE>a.b</CODE>, <CODE>a</CODE> must be of
 some structure type <CODE>A</CODE>, which must have a field named
 <CODE>b</CODE>. The type of the expression is the type of
 <CODE>b</CODE> in the structure declaration.
<LI>For an array access <CODE>a[i]</CODE>, <CODE>a</CODE> must be of
 some array type <CODE>T[n]</CODE>, and the type of the expression is
 <CODE>T</CODE>.
<LI>The type of a <CODE>peek()</CODE> or <CODE>pop()</CODE> expression
 is the input type of the filter.
<LI>The parameter of a <CODE>peek()</CODE> expression and the index
 of an array must both be of type <CODE>int</CODE>.
<LI>The type of a call to a helper function is the return type of
 that function.
</OL>
<LI>The type of the parameter of a <CODE>push()</CODE> statement must
 be the output type of the filter.
<LI>The type of the parameter of an <CODE>enqueue()</CODE> statement
 must be the output type of the feedback loop's loop stream.
<LI>The type of the right-hand side of an assignment statement must
 be promotable to the type of the left-hand side of the statement.
</OL>
<!--TOC subsection Using Names As Types-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc8">2.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Names As Types</H3><!--SEC END -->

<OL type=1><LI>
A bare name may be used as a type in a variable declaration,
 parameter list, stream type, and elsewhere. The name must match the
 name of a declared structure type.
<LI>A bare name may be used as the target type of a
 <CODE>Portal</CODE> type. The name must match the name of a declared
 stream type; the target of a portal may not be a primitive type or
 structure.
</OL>
<!--TOC subsection Messaging-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc9">2.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Messaging</H3><!--SEC END -->

<OL type=1><LI>

<OL type=1><LI>
No two streams or structures may have the same name.
<LI>Within a single structure, no two member fields may have the
 same name. Field names must also be distinct from all stream and
 structure names.
<LI>Stream parameters within a single stream must have distinct
 names from each other and from all stream and structure names.
<LI>Functions declared within a filter must have unique names; these
 include message handlers and helper functions. The name of a
 function must be distinct from stream and structure names.
<LI>A variable may not be declared with the same name as a stream
 parameter. (Other variable hiding is legal.) The name of a
 variable must be distinct from stream, structure, and function
 names within the current filter.
</OL>
<!--TOC subsection Using Names-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc12">3.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Names</H3><!--SEC END -->

<OL type=1><LI>
A stream constructor (the parameter to <CODE>add</CODE>,
 <CODE>body</CODE>, and <CODE>loop</CODE> statements) must be an
 anonymous stream declaration, or must have a name matching the name
 of a stream object with a parameter list matching the parameter list
 of the the stream.
<LI>A variable must be declared before it is used.
<LI>A stream parameter may not be assigned to or otherwise modified.
<LI>A function call must have a name matching a helper function in

 left-hand side of the ``.'', and a message name on the right-hand
 side. The message name must match a message in the target type of
 the portal, and the statement must have a parameter list matching
 the parameter list of the message target.
</OL>
<!--TOC section Warnings-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc13">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Warnings</H2><!--SEC END -->

Things in this section are technically legal, but indicate
questionable code:
<OL type=1><LI>
Some things in StreamIt are counted; these include split-join
 children (with fixed-length weighted round-robin splitters or
 joiners), and work function pushes, pops, and peeks. It should be a
 warning if the compiler cannot statically confirm that these numbers
 are not met exactly (or, for peeks, that the peek rate is not
 exceeded). For feedback loops, the compiler can also issue a
 warning if it cannot confirm that enough items are enqueued to cause
 the joiner to be fired at the start of the program.
<LI>The compiler may need to guess at the I/O types of anonymous
 streams. If the type isn't clear from context a warning should be
 issued.
<LI>A warning may be issued if the compiler cannot verify that
 splitters and joiners for split-joins can accomodate the exact
 number of children present. Note that this may only be possible
 with pattern-matching program text, or by fully unrolling init
 functions, since the following code is legitimate but data-flow
 wouldn't find an exact number of children:<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=left><TT> </TT><TT>
</TT><TT>float-&gt;float&nbsp;splitjoin&nbsp;FiveChildren&nbsp;{</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;split&nbsp;roundrobin(1,2,3,4,5);</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;(int&nbsp;i&nbsp;=&nbsp;0;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;5;&nbsp;i++)</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add&nbsp;float-&gt;float&nbsp;filter&nbsp;{&nbsp;...&nbsp;};</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;join&nbsp;roundrobin(5,4,3,2,1);</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>}</TT></DIV></OL>
<!--TOC section Temporary Checks-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc14">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary Checks</H2><!--SEC END -->

These checks are necessary due to current constraints in the StreamIt
compiler. They should be able to be removed when the compiler is
improved.
<OL type=1><LI>
All child-constructing statements in initialization code must
 have consistent types. While the front-end can perform minimal
 data-flow analysis to check that the types of pipelines, control
 flow like the following is presently illegal:<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=left><TT> </TT><TT>
</TT><TT>int-&gt;int&nbsp;filter&nbsp;IntIntBody&nbsp;{&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>int-&gt;int&nbsp;filter&nbsp;IntIntLoop&nbsp;{&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>float-&gt;int&nbsp;filter&nbsp;FloatIntBody&nbsp;{&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>int-&gt;float&nbsp;filter&nbsp;IntFloatLoop&nbsp;{&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>void-&gt;int&nbsp;feedbackloop&nbsp;SketchyLoop(int&nbsp;p)&nbsp;{</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;join&nbsp;roundrobin(0,&nbsp;1);</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;(p)&nbsp;{</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body&nbsp;IntIntBody();</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop&nbsp;IntIntLoop();</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;else&nbsp;{</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body&nbsp;FloatIntBody();</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop&nbsp;IntFloatLoop();</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;split&nbsp;duplicate;</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;enqueue(1);</TT><TT><BR>
</TT><TT>}</TT></DIV><BR>
 The types of the loop and all of its components are consistent
 regardless of the value of <CODE>p</CODE>, but if <CODE>p</CODE> is
 zero, the <CODE>enqueue</CODE> statement takes a <CODE>float</CODE>
 parameter. Presently the front-end should reject this construction
 since it is unclear if the types around the joiner are consistent or
 not. This check can be removed if the compiler does stream
 type-checking after constant propagation.
<LI>None of the names listed in the ``Implementation Limits''
 section of the language specification should be used. These include
 the capitalized names <CODE>SplitJoin</CODE>,
 <CODE>FeedbackLoop</CODE>, <CODE>Filter</CODE>, <CODE>Pipeline</CODE>,
 <CODE>StreamIt</CODE>, and <CODE>Complex</CODE>.
